Graph. I have probably avoided this Data structure my entire schooling if I am being honest.

The concept scares me but to be honest they a trees with less rules.

1) There is no "root" node. 
What this implies is why I have avoided them for this long. You cannot assume a position unless it is from the perspective of the node you are currently at.

2) Nodes are actually Vertices they are conceptually the same thing. People just know that when you say vertex you are explicitly talking about graphs and their ruleset.

3) There are many types of graphs and I will be implementing them all eventually. There will be a README possibly explaining each. 

Note: this is entirely for my knowledge, teaching myself helps me retain the knowledge.
