# LinkedList
(These are my own words)

Random things I know about linkedlists.

So a linkedlist is like an array but stored on the heap. An array is stored in sequential memory blocks. The heap as I should already know is uses ram which is way faster than accessing memory on HDD or other storage devices. (probably because the I/O cost of reading from the device) SO you can see the appeal of one over the other in different situations.

Arrays offer quick look up. Linkedlists much search sequentially. Either way they are used to hold data in a sequential type of way. Like element 1-k where k is the max number of elements.

A linkedlist consists of NODES which took me forever to understand the concept. For whoever is reading this, a NODE is just a container. YOU define what a node is. Does it hold ints strings, etc? YOU decide! This is why I did not understand because every example of a NODE was different. 

NODES must point to something for linkedlist to work.

Think of linkedlist like a snake. There is a head and a tail each section of the snake is a node with data inside of it. A linkedlist with nothing in it by definition is simply a node that points to nothing at its head. Nothing = NULL btw

Linkedlists use more memory because of NODES require pointers to the next one. Think of it like a chain... a "linked" list... lol. You access the head to get to the rest of them.

I will explain more later!

For now... this folder will contain all of my implementations in every language I know I can do them in... because practice. This is by no means an attempt to memorize anything. Im done with that lifestyle... documentation exists for a reason.

I am very strict of structure or I at least try to be... I see so many implementations without functions and its done in main functions.. so messy.. anyways check it out!
