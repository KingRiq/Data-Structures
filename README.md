# Data-Structures

This repo will be used to develop my understanding of Data Structures(DS) in diferent programming languages. I hav pre-coded alot of the information contained within and there are plenty of resources tht already have code snippets available. This is purely for my education. 

AS AN ASIDE... I PURPOSEFULLY!!! am not using IDEs for learning purposes so bear with me.
